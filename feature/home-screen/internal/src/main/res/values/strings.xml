<string name="home_screen_welcome_message"><p>Welcome to HoloCanon, an unofficial canon tracker for the Star Wars universe.</p>

        \n\n<p>If you find any bugs, incorrect information, or have any general suggestions for the app, then feel free to join our %1$s.
        You\'re also welcome if you just want to chat about your favorite Star Wars content.</p>

        \n\n<p>The purpose of this app is to make it easier to keep track of all of the currently canonical content in the Star Wars universe.
        The list can be sorted by release date, title, media type, or in-universe timeline (which is a constant work-in-progress).
        I\'m always open to suggestions for more filtering/sorting methods.</p>

        \n\n<p>Images and database updates only download on unmetered (usually wifi) networks by default.
        This behavior can be changed in the settings, where you can also force a database sync.</p>

        \n\n<p>In settings you can also change the text associated to the checkboxes as well as permanently filter out certain media types (such as "youth").</p></string>
