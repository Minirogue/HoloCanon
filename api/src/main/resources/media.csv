1,Episode IV: A New Hope,Movie,https://minirogue.github.io/SWCovers/Movies/a_new_hope.jpg,5/25/1977,0,The movie that started it all. Luke Skywalker is a young moisture farmer with a great destiny ahead as he journeys into space to save the princess and get the Empire's evil plans into the hands of the heroic terrorist group known as the Rebel Alliance.,Star Wars (movies),4,20th Century Fox,,You don't care what I think about this one. I'll spare you.,https://amzn.to/2XlYFcp,,George Lucas,,0
2,Episode V: Empire Strikes Back,Movie,https://minirogue.github.io/SWCovers/Movies/empire_strikes_back.jpg,6/20/1980,3,In this sequel the Empire strikes back! Oh; you already knew that? Okay; well Lando's in this one. So that's cool.,Star Wars (movies),5,20th Century Fox,,,https://amzn.to/2IRdmeu,,George Lucas,,
4,Episode VI: Return of the Jedi,Movie,https://minirogue.github.io/SWCovers/Movies/return_of_the_jedi.jpg,5/25/1983,4,The thrilling conclusion of the Star Wars saga (until extended universe novels dealt with what happens after this movie; and then Disney acquired the franchise and decided this wasn't the end).,Star Wars (movies),6,20th Century Fox,,,https://amzn.to/2XmaBeo,,George Lucas,,
7,Episode I: The Phantom Menace,Movie,https://minirogue.github.io/SWCovers/Movies/the_phantom_menace.jpg,5/19/1999,-32,The fourth Star Wars movie; but the first episode; because George Lucas said so. This is the beginning of the prequel trilogy; taking place in a time of relative peace when Jedi numbered in the thousands and the Sith had been eradicated. Oh wait; there's a Sith... Uh oh.,Star Wars (movies),1,20th Century Fox,,Everyone's got their opinions about the prequels. Here's mine: don't think too hard about the plot; and this is a pretty fun movie. Whether or not the scene takes too long; pod racing is cool. I dressed up as Darth Maul for halloween several years when I was a kid. Jar Jar is terrible; a lot of the CGI has not aged super well; and kid Anakin is about what you'd expect from a kid actor (before Stranger Things upped our expectations). BUT - and hear me out here - Duel of Fates.,https://amzn.to/2XmAPNM,,George Lucas,,-32
8,Episode II: Attack of the Clones,Movie,https://minirogue.github.io/SWCovers/Movies/attack_of_the_clones.jpg,5/16/2002,-22,This is the move that comes after episode I and before episode III.,Star Wars (movies),2,20th Century Fox,,I don't really have much to say about this movie other than this is the movie after I and before episode III.,https://amzn.to/2IorgFY,,George Lucas,,-22
9,Episode III: Revenge of the Sith,Movie,https://minirogue.github.io/SWCovers/Movies/revenge_of_the_sith.jpg,5/19/2005,-19,The thrilling preclusion... wait that doesn't mean conclusion of prequels; but pretend it does. It's the last movie of the prequel trilogy. A lot of people like this one best of the prequels. I was always more of a Phantom Menace kinda guy; but I will admit that this one has the best Anakin hair.,Star Wars (movies),3,20th Century Fox,,,https://amzn.to/2IRdfQ6,,George Lucas,,-19
10,The Clone Wars,Movie,https://minirogue.github.io/SWCovers/Movies/the_clone_wars.jpg,8/15/2008,-21,Computer animated move which serves as a prologue for the TV series of the same name.,The Clone Wars,0,Warner Bros.,,Is it good? No. But is the Clone Wars TV series good? I think so (eventually; anyways). You can skip this and just watch the series; though. All you need to know is Anakin got a padawan named Ahsoka. There; I saved you an hour and 38 minutes... You're still going to watch it anyways; because you're a completionist and that's why you downloaded this app; aren't you? *sigh* Don't say I didn't try.,https://amzn.to/2IpRrfq,,,,-21

The audiobook is narrated by Ashley Eckstein; who voiced Ahsoka in The Clone Wars.,,,Disney-Lucasfilm Press,4,This is a book that will appeal to anyone who watched The Clone Wars; as it explains her fate following the series. I personally enjoyed seeing a more mature version of her than what we see in most of TCW. It would also be good for those who have watched Rebels as there is a run-in with an inquisitor; and a few other reasons that I don't want to spoil. I definitely had a lot of fun watching dots being connected between the two shows. If you haven't watched either show; then I'd say you could probably pass on this book (at least until you watch one of those shows).,https://amzn.to/2Rm9aax,,,,-18

19,Dooku: Jedi Lost,Audiobook,https://minirogue.github.io/SWCovers/Novels/dooku_jedi_lost.jpg,4/30/2019,-40,Dooku: Jedi Lost follows the story of Dooku from his time as a Jedi Initiate through his departure from the Jedi Order. It's told through flashbacks as Asajj Ventress learns about his history. It ties into Master & Apprentice a little bit; as the character of Rael Aveross appears in both.,,,Random House,5,I thought it was interesting to see Dooku's youth; and to see his motivations. It was enjoyable; but ultimately I'm not sure I found this as an adequate explanation for who he became. This explores some of the ethical questions regarding of the nature of the Jedi Order; which I always want to explore more. As it is only available in audiobook; it is worth noting that the voice of Dooku doesn't sound at all like Sir Christopher Lee; which I found distracting and disappointing. Otherwise; the voice acting is generally pretty good. All of the other characters that have previous on-screen appearances (Asajj; Yoda; Qui-Gon; etc.) all have well-approximated voices. I particularly enjoyed young Qui-Gon Jinn; although it may have sounded just a bit silly.,https://amzn.to/2J5QckP,,,,

It follows a rag-tag group (but the author is good enough to never refers to the group as rag-tag (show don't tell; y'all)) that comes together for the purpose of bringing down a Tie Fighter squad known as Shadow Wing. This novel ties in with the Tie Fighter comics.,Alphabet Squadrion (trilogy),,Del Rey Books,22,Just wow. I really really liked this book a lot. The characters are unique; interesting; and believable. If you're at all into the whole starfighter aspect of the Star Wars universe; or are curious about what happened after Episode VI; then this is a must-read. Otherwise; it's still a must-read.,https://amzn.to/2KZ96Mx,,,,
