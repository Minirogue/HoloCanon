    <string name="update_0_1_4">Version 0.1.4: This update should improve stability (i.e. the app shouldn\'t crash so much anymore).</string>
    <string name="update_0_1_0">Version 0.1.0: Initial release! Hooraaaay!
        I\'m still working on fixing up release dates, images, and timeline in the database.
        It should automatically update when I do that.
        This app downloads the database and images, so try not to use it without wifi for now.
        Future versions will have an option to not download unless on wifi.</string>
