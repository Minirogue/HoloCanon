    <string name="welcome_message">Welcome to &appname;, an unofficial canon tracker for the Star Wars universe.
        Click on "Settings" in the navigation to change the text for the checkboxes and to permanently filter out
        certain media types. Come find me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/holocanon">@HoloCanon</a>.
        I\'ve also got a <a href="https://discord.gg/RxXvTfX">Discord server</a> set up, which would be a great way to make suggestions for this app.</string>

    <string name="update_1_0_2">Version 1.0.2: Changed app name to better comply with Google Play\'s rules.
        Cleaned up the individual item layout so the descriptions and reviews (that I\'m working on adding) show up cleanly.</string>
    <string name="update_1_0_1">Version 1.0.1: Added links to purchase items from Amazon to the canonical items pages.
    Using these links to purchase things will help support this app. Also changed the color of the sort/filter buttons.</string>
    <string name="update_1_0_0">Version 1.0.0: First full release.</string>
    <string name="update_0_1_6">Version 0.1.6: Now restricts downloading of data to unmetered networks only. This feature can
    be turned off in the settings.
        Updating is now also done silently in the background unless forced from the settings menu.
    Some small modifications were made to the layout of the list items. Namely I made the thumbnail a little bigger and stopped long titles from crashing into the checkboxes.
    0.1.6b: Fixed a crash that occurred when trying to view a media item that doesn\'t have a downloaded thumbnail. Also added this update text.</string>
    <string name="update_0_1_5">Version 0.1.5: Some more stability fixes.
    There was a crash involving clicking on a media item and opening the page for that item that should be fixed.
    Images should load much smoother now.
        Plans for the coming updates: remembering filters, wifi-only downloading of database and images, updating database.
        Don\'t forget to leave feedback or e-mail me through the play store entry so I know what else can be done to improve the app.
    </string>
    <string name="update_0_1_4">Version 0.1.4: This update should improve stability (i.e. the app shouldn\'t crash so much anymore).</string>
    <string name="update_0_1_0">Version 0.1.0: Initial release! Hooraaaay!
        I\'m still working on fixing up release dates, images, and timeline in the database.
        It should automatically update when I do that.
        This app downloads the database and images, so try not to use it without wifi for now.
        Future versions will have an option to not download unless on wifi.</string>
