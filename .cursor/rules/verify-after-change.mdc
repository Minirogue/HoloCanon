# Verify After Change

After making any code change in this project, run the full verification suite:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug testDebugUnitTest jvmTest :api:test detekt lint --continue 2>&1 | tail -120
```

- Run this command **after** completing edits (e.g. after fixing a bug, adding a feature, or refactoring).
- If the command fails, fix any reported issues (detekt/lint violations or test failures) before considering the change done.
- Prefer running from the project root (`HoloCanon`).
